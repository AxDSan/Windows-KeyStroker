Still this is pretty early in development, it doesn't do literally anything for the main functionality of the program, apart the animations that are working, nevertheless, pretty is promissing, I'll continue further development on my free time.

Side Note: This projest is being [streamed live](https://www.livecoding.tv/0x90) so if you see that I'm streaming live go ahead and join me as I code the app!
